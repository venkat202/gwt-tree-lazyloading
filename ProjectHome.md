This project is a template on how to implement a lazy loading tree. A lazy loading tree is a common technique for dealing with large trees. Advantages are faster startup time and less memory usage. Disadvantage is expanding a tree item is slower than if the tree was fully constructed. Tree itemâ€™s children are fetched via a remote service.  Folks can implement their own com.wyeth.bioinfo.server.GWTTreeServiceImpl.
